This is a **React Native** project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), designed to provide an immersive movie browsing experience. 

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Start the App

To run the app in development mode, execute:

```bash
npx expo start
```

You'll have the option to open the app using:
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for quick testing

## 📂 Project Structure

This project follows a **file-based routing** system. You can start developing by modifying files inside the **app/** directory.

```
/movie-app
│── app/
│   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── HomeScreen.js
│   │   ├── MovieDetailsScreen.js
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── MovieCard.js

```

## 🔄 Reset Project

If you need a fresh start, run:

```bash
